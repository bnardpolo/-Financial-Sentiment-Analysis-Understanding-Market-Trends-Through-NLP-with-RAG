Financial Sentiment Analysis: Understanding Market Trends Through NLP with RAG
A financial sentiment analysis tool that tracks market trends using NLP, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and visualizations. It includes real-time sentiment retrieval, stock price correlations, and sector-based insights to improve investment decision-making.

📌 Introduction
Financial markets are driven by sentiment, investor behavior, and economic trends. Traditional sentiment analysis relies on pre-collected datasets, which can quickly become outdated. This project enhances financial sentiment tracking by incorporating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fetch real-time financial news and market trends, ensuring more accurate, up-to-date sentiment insights.

By processing financial news headlines, market data, and investor sentiment, this project identifies investment opportunities, risks, and sector trends.

🔹 Key Features
✅ Real-time Sentiment Analysis using RAG to fetch and analyze financial news.
✅ Market Trend Analysis correlating sentiment scores with stock price movements & volatility.
✅ Stock Price & Sentiment Correlation to track how news impacts markets.
✅ Sector-Wise Financial Insights for data-driven investment strategies.
✅ Interactive Data Visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

🚀 How Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Enhances Sentiment Analysis
Traditional sentiment analysis models process static datasets, limiting their ability to react to real-time financial events. RAG dynamically retrieves market news and trends, ensuring that sentiment scores are always based on the most recent information available.

🔹 How RAG Works in This Project
1️⃣ Retrieves real-time financial news & stock market data from APIs and indexed sources.
2️⃣ Generates sentiment insights by grounding analysis in retrieved documents instead of outdated datasets.
3️⃣ Enhances investment predictions by incorporating live market movements & volatility indicators.

🔹 Technologies Used for RAG Implementation
Vector Database (FAISS, Pinecone) → Stores and retrieves relevant financial data.
Large Language Models (GPT-4, Llama) → Generates sentiment-based financial insights.
Financial APIs (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage) → Fetches real-time stock data.
TF-IDF & Embeddings → Used for retrieving the most relevant financial documents.
🔹 Why Use RAG for Sentiment Analysis?
✅ Ensures insights are based on live financial data, preventing outdated predictions.
✅ Reduces hallucinations in LLM-generated insights by grounding responses in retrieved financial documents.
✅ Improves investment recommendations & risk assessments with real-time news and stock correlations.

🛠️ Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Collection & Preparation
Financial News Retrieval: News headlines are retrieved using APIs and vector-based storage.
Market Data Integration: Stock price movements and volatility metrics are collected and processed.
Sentiment Scoring: News headlines are analyzed using TextBlob & NLP models for sentiment classification.
2️⃣ Sentiment Analysis & Scoring
Each financial news headline is assigned a sentiment polarity score:

Sentiment Type	Polarity Range	Meaning
Positive	0 to +1	Indicates optimism & growth.
Neutral	~0	Suggests market stability or mixed views.
Negative	-1 to 0	Highlights risks, downturns, or pessimism.
📊 Example Sentiment Scores from Financial News

News Headline	Sentiment Score	Sentiment Type
"Tech stocks are booming amid AI innovation"	0.00	Neutral
"EV demand drops due to charging infrastructure concerns"	-0.125	Negative
"Renewable energy investments hit record high"	0.160	Positive
"Regulations slow down fintech growth"	-0.227	Negative
"Stock market crashes as inflation rises"	0.00	Neutral
3️⃣ Market Trends & Sentiment Correlation
📈 Stock Market & Sentiment Correlation

Negative news sentiment often aligns with high market volatility.
AI & Renewable Energy sectors maintain strong positive sentiment.
EV sector sentiment is mixed, reflecting investor uncertainty about adoption & infrastructure.
