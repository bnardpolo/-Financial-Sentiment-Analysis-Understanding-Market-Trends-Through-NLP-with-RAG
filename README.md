## Understanding Market Trends Through NLP and Retrieval-Augmented Generation

This project introduces a financial sentiment analysis tool designed to track market trends using natural language processing, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and data visualization. It provides real-time sentiment retrieval, stock price correlation, and sector-based insights to support better investment decisions.

### Introduction  
Financial markets are influenced by investor sentiment, behavior, and macroeconomic signals. Traditional sentiment analysis often relies on static datasets, which can quickly become outdated. This tool improves sentiment tracking by integrating RAG, allowing it to pull current financial news and market data to generate more accurate and timely insights.

By analyzing headlines, market movements, and investor tone, the system identifies opportunities, flags risks, and highlights sector trends.

### Key Features  
- Real-time sentiment analysis using RAG to retrieve and process financial news  
- Market trend analysis that links sentiment scores to stock price changes and volatility  
- Sentiment and price correlation to measure how news impacts market behavior  
- Sector-level insights to guide strategic investment decisions  
- Interactive visualizations built with Matplotlib and Seaborn

### How RAG Enhances Sentiment Analysis  
Traditional models rely on static inputs, limiting their responsiveness to new events. RAG improves this by dynamically retrieving relevant financial documents and grounding sentiment analysis in current information.

### RAG Implementation Overview  
- Retrieves financial news and market data from APIs and indexed sources  
- Generates sentiment insights based on retrieved documents rather than outdated datasets  
- Enhances predictions by incorporating live market signals and volatility metrics

### Technologies Used  
- Vector databases such as FAISS and Pinecone for document retrieval  
- Large language models like GPT-4 and Llama for sentiment generation  
- Financial APIs including Yahoo Finance and Alpha Vantage for real-time data  
- TF-IDF and embeddings for document relevance scoring

### Benefits of Using RAG  
- Keeps sentiment insights aligned with live market conditions  
- Reduces hallucinations in language model outputs by grounding responses  
- Improves investment recommendations and risk assessments through real-time correlations

### Project Workflow  
1. Data Collection and Preparation  
   - Financial news is retrieved via APIs and stored in vector databases  
   - Market data including price changes and volatility is integrated  
   - Sentiment scores are assigned using TextBlob and NLP models  

2. Sentiment Scoring  
   - Each headline receives a polarity score:  
     - Positive (0 to +1): signals optimism and growth  
     - Neutral (around 0): suggests stability or mixed sentiment  
     - Negative (-1 to 0): indicates risk or pessimism  

Example Sentiment Scores:  
- "Tech stocks are booming amid AI innovation" → Neutral  
- "EV demand drops due to charging infrastructure concerns" → Negative  
- "Renewable energy investments hit record high" → Positive  
- "Regulations slow down fintech growth" → Negative  
- "Stock market crashes as inflation rises" → Neutral  

3. Market Trends and Sentiment Correlation  
- Negative sentiment often coincides with higher volatility  
- AI and renewable energy sectors show strong positive sentiment  
- EV sector sentiment is mixed, reflecting uncertainty around infrastructure  

Example Market Data:  
- January 31: Price change 0.03 percent, volatility 2.65  
- February 29: Price change 0.58 percent, volatility 1.13  
- March 31: Price change 1.79 percent, volatility 3.42  
- April 30: Price change 1.65 percent, volatility 1.14  
- May 31: Price change 0.17 percent, volatility 1.11  

Sector Sentiment Breakdown:  
- EV: 12 positive, 8 neutral, 5 negative  
- Renewable Energy: 15 positive, 6 neutral, 4 negative  
- Technology: 10 positive, 9 neutral, 7 negative  
- Automotive: 14 positive, 5 neutral, 3 negative  
- AI: 18 positive, 7 neutral, 6 negative  

### Key Findings and Business Implications  
- AI and renewable energy sectors show strong investor confidence  
- EV sector sentiment is mixed, pointing to infrastructure and policy concerns  
- Technology sector shows volatility, suggesting investor caution  
- Market trends often mirror sentiment shifts, reinforcing the value of RAG-powered retrieval for forecasting
